# Lady Blackbird

This is an "open source remake" of the popular Lady Blackbird tabletop RPG from http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/. 

The goal was to recreate the original as closely as possible to allow the community to create semi-official translations.
To reach that goal, we use LaTeX; software like MS Word or similar would be easier to use to create a new document but harder to make an exact copy.

So far, there is the English remake and a German WIP version. Ports to other languages are always welcome.
